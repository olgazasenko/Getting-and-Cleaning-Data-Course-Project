To run the analysis on data, source the file ***run_analysis.R***. It downloads the data from the website, unzips it and merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Then the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement are extracted to perform analysis on them.

In the process of tidying up this dataset, the code uses descriptive activity names to name the activities. Then it also ppropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

Finally, a second, independent tidy data set is created, with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
